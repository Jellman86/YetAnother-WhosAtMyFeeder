## 🎯 Top Priority Features

These are the highest-impact features planned for the next major release.

### 1. AI Integration Persistence 🧠
**Priority:** P1 | **Effort:** M (5-7 days)

Add persistent storage for AI-generated behavioral analyses to reduce API costs and improve response times.

**Why This Matters:**
Currently, every time you view a detection and request AI analysis, it makes a fresh API call to Gemini/OpenAI/Claude. This is expensive ($$$ API costs) and slow. By caching analyses, I can:
- Reduce API costs by 90%+ (only generate once per detection)
- Instant display of previously generated analyses
- Allow offline viewing of past analyses
- Track which AI model/version generated each analysis

**What Will Be Implemented:**

**Database Schema (1 day):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_analyses (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  detection_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES detections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  provider VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'gemini', 'openai', 'claude'
  model VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,    -- 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp', 'gpt-4o', etc.
  analysis_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSON,                  -- token usage, temperature, etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(detection_id, provider, model)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_ai_analyses_detection ON ai_analyses(detection_id);
```

**Backend (3 days):**
- Update `ai_service.py` to check cache before API call
- Store all successful analyses in `ai_analyses` table
- Add TTL/expiration logic (configurable, default: never expire)
- Add settings option: `llm.cache_enabled` (default: true)
- Add settings option: `llm.cache_retention_days` (default: 0 = unlimited)

**API Endpoints (1 day):**
- `GET /api/detections/{id}/ai-analysis` - Get cached or generate new
  - Query param: `force_regenerate=true` to bypass cache
- `DELETE /api/detections/{id}/ai-analysis` - Clear cached analysis
- `GET /api/ai/cache/stats` - Cache statistics (hit rate, total analyses, cost saved)

**Frontend (2 days):**
- Update `SpeciesDetailModal.svelte` to show cache status:
  - "✓ Cached analysis from 2 hours ago"
  - "🔄 Regenerate" button to force fresh analysis
  - Show which model generated the analysis
- Add cache stats to Settings → AI Integration
- Add "Clear All AI Caches" button in Settings

**Estimated Breakdown:**
| Task | Effort |
|------|--------|
| Database schema & Alembic migration | 1 day |
| Backend cache implementation | 2 days |
| API endpoints | 1 day |
| Frontend UI updates | 1.5 days |
| Testing & documentation | 1 day |
| **Total** | **6.5 days (~1.5 weeks)** |

    content TEXT,
